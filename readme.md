# accessibility panel

Adobe XD plug in that supports designers in designing accessibly. This plug in allows designers to annotate and assign focus order to their designs as well as enter landmark information and meta data information to their design. This provides an easier developer hand off. 

Designers now spend less time doing manual time consuming tasks and developers can spend less time researching W3C best practices and more time making their product accessible. 

Screen readers will read this information and provide an accessible user experience for people with vision impairment. When we design accessibly, we make things better for EVERYONE. 

Democratizing accessible design.
